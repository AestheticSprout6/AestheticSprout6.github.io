    <h2>1. Understanding Your Skin Type</h2>
    <p>Before selecting an eyeliner formula, it’s essential to understand your skin type. Here’s a brief overview of common skin types and their characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oily Skin:</strong> Characterized by excess oil production, which can lead to a shiny appearance and potential for makeup to slide off or smudge.</li>
      <li><strong>Dry Skin:</strong> Prone to flakiness and tightness, which can cause makeup to look uneven or emphasize dry patches.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitive Skin:</strong> Often reacts to certain ingredients, leading to redness, irritation, or discomfort.</li>
      <li><strong>Combination Skin:</strong> A mix of oily and dry areas, requiring a balanced approach in product selection.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>2. Best Eyeliner Formulas for Oily Skin</h2>
    <p>Oily skin can pose challenges for maintaining eyeliner throughout the day. To combat these issues, consider the following formulas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Waterproof Eyeliner:</strong> Waterproof formulas are excellent for oily skin as they resist smudging and ensure long-lasting wear. Opt for liquid or gel liners that are labeled as waterproof.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Gel eyeliners are highly pigmented and provide a more solid finish compared to pencils. They adhere well to oily skin and are less likely to smudge.</li>
      <li><strong>Matte Formulas:</strong> Matte eyeliners prevent shine and are less likely to transfer. Avoid glossy or shimmer formulas that can exacerbate oiliness.</li>
      <li><strong>Setting Powders:</strong> Use a translucent setting powder on your eyelids before applying eyeliner to help absorb excess oil and improve the longevity of your liner.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Best Eyeliner Formulas for Dry Skin</h2>
    <p>Dry skin can make eyeliners appear patchy or flake off. To ensure a smooth application and comfortable wear, consider these formulas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creamy Pencils:</strong> Creamy pencil eyeliners glide smoothly over dry skin and provide a more moisturizing effect. Look for pencils that contain hydrating ingredients.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Gel liners with a creamy texture are also suitable for dry skin, as they offer a smooth application without emphasizing dryness.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydrating Liquid Liner:</strong> Some liquid liners are formulated with hydrating agents. Choose ones that are designed for sensitive or dry eyes to avoid irritation.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepping with Eye Cream:</strong> Apply a hydrating eye cream before eyeliner to ensure a smooth surface and improve the appearance of your liner.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>4. Best Eyeliner Formulas for Sensitive Skin</h2>
    <p>For sensitive skin, choosing the right eyeliner formula is key to avoiding irritation and ensuring comfort. Here are the best options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hypoallergenic Eyeliners:</strong> These eyeliners are specifically formulated to minimize the risk of allergic reactions. Look for products labeled as hypoallergenic or ophthalmologist-tested.</li>
      <li><strong>Fragrance-Free Formulas:</strong> Opt for eyeliners that do not contain added fragrances, as these can irritate sensitive skin.</li>
      <li><strong>Mineral Eyeliners:</strong> Mineral-based eyeliners are gentle and less likely to cause irritation. They often contain natural ingredients that are safe for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Many gel eyeliners are gentle on the eyes and can be suitable for sensitive skin. Ensure they are free of harsh chemicals and preservatives.</li>
    </ul>
