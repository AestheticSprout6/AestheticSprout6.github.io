    <h2>1. Understanding the Cat Eye Look</h2>
    <p>The cat eye look is defined by its winged eyeliner that extends beyond the outer corner of the eye and is angled upwards. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A cat eye is a makeup technique where eyeliner is applied in a winged shape that creates an elongated, feline-like appearance.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The cat eye look is designed to enhance and lift the eyes, making them appear more elongated and dramatic.</li>
      <li><strong>Variations:</strong> You can adjust the length and angle of the wing to suit your eye shape and desired intensity.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>2. Preparing Your Eyelids</h2>
    <p>Proper preparation is key to achieving a smooth and long-lasting cat eye. Follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clean and Moisturize:</strong> Start with clean, moisturized eyelids to create a smooth canvas. Use an eye cream that suits your skin type to ensure hydration without excess oil.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply Primer:</strong> Use an eye primer to enhance the adhesion of your eyeliner and prevent smudging. Apply it evenly across your eyelids and let it set for a few minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Set with Powder:</strong> Lightly dust a translucent setting powder over your primer to create a matte surface and reduce excess oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Choosing the Right Eyeliner</h2>
    <p>The choice of eyeliner can make a significant difference in achieving a dramatic cat eye. Consider these options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liquid Eyeliner:</strong> Ideal for precise lines and dramatic wings. Opt for a long-wearing, waterproof formula to ensure longevity and prevent smudging.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Offers a creamy texture that glides smoothly and can be used to create both sharp lines and softer, blended effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Pen Eyeliner:</strong> Provides ease of use with a felt-tip applicator, making it convenient for creating defined and consistent wings.</li>
      <li><strong>Pencil Eyeliner:</strong> Best for a softer look, but can be used in combination with other formulas to define and blend the cat eye.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Dramatic Cat Eye</h2>
    <p>Follow these detailed steps to achieve the perfect cat eye look:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Draw the Wing:</strong> Start by drawing the wing. Using your preferred eyeliner, extend a line from the outer corner of your eye, angling it upwards towards the end of your eyebrow. The length and angle of the wing can be adjusted based on your preference.</li>
      <li><strong>Create the Outline:</strong> Connect the end of the wing to the middle of your upper lash line. This will form the outline of the cat eye shape. Ensure that the line is smooth and continuous.</li>
      <li><strong>Fill in the Shape:</strong> Fill in the outlined shape with your eyeliner. Use short strokes to ensure an even application and avoid gaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Define the Inner Corner:</strong> Extend the eyeliner towards the inner corner of your eye, creating a thin line that gradually thickens as you move towards the outer corner.</li>
      <li><strong>Perfect the Wing:</strong> Use a small brush or cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to clean up and perfect the wing shape. Ensure that both wings are symmetrical and the edges are sharp.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply Mascara:</strong> Finish the look with a coat of mascara to define your lashes and complement the dramatic eyeliner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Tips for Perfecting Your Cat Eye</h2>
    <p>These additional tips will help you perfect your cat eye look:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Tape for Precision:</strong> Place a small piece of tape at the outer corner of your eye to guide the angle of your wing and ensure symmetry.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Your Technique:</strong> Practice drawing the winged shape on the back of your hand or using a light pencil to perfect your technique before applying it to your eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider Your Eye Shape:</strong> Tailor the wing shape and angle to suit your eye shape. For example, if you have hooded eyes, keep the wing more subtle and avoid excessive thickness.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain a Steady Hand:</strong> Use a steady hand and work slowly to create a precise and clean cat eye. A steady grip on the eyeliner applicator helps achieve better control.</li>
