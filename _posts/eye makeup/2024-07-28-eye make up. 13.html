    <h2>1. Brushes</h2>
    <p>Makeup brushes are fundamental tools for precise and smooth application of eyeshadow, eyeliner, and other products. Here are the essential eye makeup brushes you should have:</p>
    <h3>1.1. Blending Brush</h3>
    <p>A blending brush is crucial for seamless eyeshadow application. It has soft, fluffy bristles that help blend colors effortlessly, creating smooth transitions between shades.</p>
    <h3>1.2. Flat Shader Brush</h3>
    <p>This brush is used for packing eyeshadow onto the lid. Its dense, flat shape allows for maximum pigment payoff and precise application, especially when working with shimmery or metallic shadows.</p>
    <h3>1.3. Crease Brush</h3>
    <p>The crease brush has a tapered tip designed to fit perfectly into the crease of your eye. It helps define the crease with darker shades, adding depth and dimension to your look.</p>
    <h3>1.4. Smudge Brush</h3>
    <p>A smudge brush has short, dense bristles, making it ideal for applying and blending eyeshadow or eyeliner along the lash line. It’s perfect for creating smokey eyes or softening harsh lines.</p>
    <h3>1.5. Angled Brush</h3>
    <p>This brush is versatile for applying eyeliner and filling in eyebrows. Its angled shape allows for precise control, making it easier to draw sharp lines or define brow edges.</p>
    <h3>1.6. Pencil Brush</h3>
    <p>With a pointed tip, the pencil brush is excellent for detailing work. It’s used for applying eyeshadow to the inner corners, highlighting the brow bone, or creating more precise lines.</p>

    <h2>2. Eyelash Tools</h2>
    <p>Eyelash tools are essential for adding volume and length to your lashes, completing your eye makeup look:</p>
    <h3>2.1. Eyelash Curler</h3>
    <p>An eyelash curler is a must-have tool for lifting and curling your lashes. Curling your lashes opens up the eyes and makes them appear larger and more awake.</p>
    <h3>2.2. Mascara Wand</h3>
    <p>While most mascaras come with their own wands, having an extra clean mascara wand (or spoolie) is useful for separating lashes, removing clumps, and grooming eyebrows.</p>
    <h3>2.3. False Eyelash Applicator</h3>
    <p>If you enjoy wearing false lashes, an applicator tool can make the process easier and more precise. It helps you place the lashes close to the lash line and secure them without using your fingers.</p>
    <h3>2.4. Tweezers</h3>
    <p>Tweezers are not only for grooming your eyebrows but also for applying false lashes. They allow for precise placement and adjustment, ensuring the lashes sit perfectly on your natural lash line.</p>

    <h2>3. Eyeliner Tools</h2>
    <p>Eyeliner tools help you achieve different styles, from subtle definitions to bold, dramatic lines:</p>
    <h3>3.1. Eyeliner Brush</h3>
    <p>If you use gel or cream eyeliner, an eyeliner brush is essential. Look for a fine-tipped or angled brush for precise application. It allows you to create sharp lines or softer, smokey effects.</p>
    <h3>3.2. Pencil Sharpener</h3>
    <p>Keeping your eyeliner pencils sharp ensures precise application and prevents tugging on the delicate eye area. A good-quality sharpener keeps your pencils in optimal condition.</p>
