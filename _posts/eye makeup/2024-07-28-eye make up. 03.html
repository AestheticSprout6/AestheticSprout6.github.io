    <h2>1. Prepping the Eyes</h2>
    <p>Preparation is key to achieving long-lasting and vibrant eye makeup. Follow these steps to prep your eyes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cleanse and Moisturize:</strong> Start with a clean face. Use a gentle cleanser to remove any dirt or oil from your eyelids. Follow with an eye cream to hydrate the delicate skin around your eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Prime:</strong> Apply an eye primer to your lids. This creates a smooth base for your eyeshadow and helps it stay in place throughout the day. If you don't have a primer, a light layer of concealer can work as a substitute.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Applying Eyeshadow</h2>
    <p>Eyeshadow can add color and depth to your eyes. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to applying eyeshadow:</p>
    <h3>2.1. Transition Shade</h3>
    <p>Start with a transition shade that is slightly darker than your skin tone. This will help blend all the other colors seamlessly. Use a fluffy blending brush to apply the transition shade to your crease in windshield-wiper motions.</p>
    <h3>2.2. Lid Color</h3>
    <p>Choose a medium-toned eyeshadow for your lid. Use a flat eyeshadow brush to pack the color onto your lid, avoiding the crease. Patting the eyeshadow onto your lid rather than swiping it will give you more pigment and reduce fallout.</p>
    <h3>2.3. Crease Color</h3>
    <p>To add depth, apply a darker shade into the crease. Use a smaller blending brush to apply the color in a back-and-forth motion. Make sure to blend well to avoid harsh lines. This step defines your eye shape and adds dimension.</p>
    <h3>2.4. Outer V</h3>
    <p>For extra drama, apply an even darker shade to the outer corner of your eye in a 'V' shape. This technique is excellent for creating a smokey effect. Use a precise brush and blend it into the crease color.</p>
    <h3>2.5. Highlight</h3>
    <p>Finish by highlighting your brow bone and inner corner of the eye with a shimmery or light eyeshadow. This brightens the eyes and makes them appear larger. Use a small brush for precise application.</p>

    <h2>3. Eyeliner Application</h2>
    <p>Eyeliner can define and shape your eyes, making them stand out. Here are various techniques to try:</p>
    <h3>3.1. Classic Line</h3>
    <p>For a natural look, draw a thin line along your upper lash line. Use a pencil or liquid liner, starting from the inner corner and working your way out. Keep the line as close to the lashes as possible.</p>
    <h3>3.2. Winged Eyeliner</h3>
    <p>Winged eyeliner adds a touch of glamour and elongates the eyes. To create a wing, draw a line from the outer corner of your eye, angling towards the end of your eyebrow. Connect this line back to the middle of your lash line and fill in the gap.</p>
    <h3>3.3. Tightlining</h3>
    <p>Tightlining involves applying eyeliner to the upper waterline (the area underneath your upper lashes). This technique makes your lashes appear fuller and defines your eyes subtly. Use a waterproof pencil liner for this step.</p>
    <h3>3.4. Smudged Eyeliner</h3>
    <p>For a smokey effect, apply pencil liner along your upper and lower lash lines. Then, use a smudging brush or Q-tip to soften the line. This creates a more diffused and sultry look.</p>

    <h2>4. Mascara Application</h2>
    <p>Mascara is essential for adding volume and length to your lashes, completing your eye makeup look. Follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Curl Your Lashes:</strong> Use an eyelash curler to lift your lashes. Hold the curler at the base of your lashes for a few seconds, then move it upwards for a natural curl.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply Mascara:</strong> Start at the base of your lashes and wiggle the wand upwards to the tips. This ensures each lash is coated and helps prevent clumping. For extra volume, apply multiple coats, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower Lashes:</strong> Use the tip of the mascara wand to lightly coat your lower lashes. This opens up the eyes and completes the look.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Eyebrow Shaping and Filling</h2>
    <p>Well-groomed eyebrows frame your face and enhance your eye makeup. Hereâ€™s how to shape and fill your brows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Brush Your Brows:</strong> Use a spoolie brush to comb your eyebrows into shape. This helps you see any sparse areas that need filling.</li>
      <li><strong>Fill in Sparse Areas:</strong> Use an eyebrow pencil, powder, or pomade to fill in any gaps. Follow the natural shape of your brows, using light, feathery strokes for a natural look.</li>
      <li><strong>Blend:</strong> After filling in, use the spoolie brush again to blend the product, ensuring there are no harsh lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Set Your Brows:</strong> Use a clear or tinted brow gel to set your eyebrows in place. This keeps them looking neat and defined throughout the day.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Eye Makeup Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>
    <p>Even with the best techniques, it's easy to make mistakes. Here are some common eye makeup mistakes and tips to avoid them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Skipping Primer:</strong> Not using an eye primer can lead to creased and faded eyeshadow. Always prep your lids with primer or concealer.</li>
      <li><strong>Over-Applying Eyeshadow:</strong> Too much product can look heavy and unblended. Start with a small amount and build up the color gradually.</li>
      <li><strong>Harsh Lines:</strong> Unblended eyeshadow or eyeliner can look harsh. Always blend your eyeshadow well and soften eyeliner with a smudging tool if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring Your Eye Shape:</strong> Different eye shapes require different techniques. Tailor your makeup to enhance your unique features.</li>
      <li><strong>Using Old Mascara:</strong> Mascara has a short shelf life. Using old mascara can lead to clumping and eye infections. Replace your mascara every three months.</li>
    </ul>
