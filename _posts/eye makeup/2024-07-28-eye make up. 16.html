    <h2>1. Understanding Hooded Eyes</h2>
    <p>Hooded eyes have a distinctive fold of skin that hangs over the crease, which can make it challenging to apply eyeliner in a way that shows up clearly. Here’s what you need to know about hooded eyes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The eyelid appears partially covered when the eyes are open, making the crease less visible. This can make eyeliner application tricky.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Traditional eyeliner techniques may not work well, as the lid fold can cause smudging or make the liner less visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> The aim is to create a look that enhances the eye shape, opens up the eyes, and prevents the liner from disappearing under the fold.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Best Eyeliner Techniques for Hooded Eyes</h2>
    <p>To make the most of your eyeliner and ensure it complements your hooded eyes, consider these expert techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thin and Precise Lines:</strong> A thin line along the upper lash line is ideal. This technique helps to define the eyes without overwhelming them. Use a pencil or liquid liner for precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Winged Liner Above the Fold:</strong> Create a wing that extends above the fold of your eyelid. This technique ensures that the wing is visible even when your eyes are open. Make sure the wing is angled upward to lift the eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Use a Matte Formula:</strong> Matte eyeliners are less likely to transfer to the upper lid and are better for creating clean, sharp lines. They also avoid adding extra shine that can accentuate the hooded fold.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply Liner in Short Strokes:</strong> Instead of drawing a continuous line, use short, connected strokes. This approach gives you more control and helps you avoid mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Inner Rim Lining:</strong> Line the inner rim of your lower lash line to enhance the eyes. This technique makes the eyes appear larger and more defined, complementing the upper eyeliner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Step-by-Step Guide for Applying Eyeliner on Hooded Eyes</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps for a flawless eyeliner application on hooded eyes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prime Your Lids:</strong> Start by applying an eye primer to create a smooth base and help your eyeliner adhere better.</li>
      <li><strong>Define the Upper Lash Line:</strong> Use a thin eyeliner pencil or liquid liner to trace a fine line along the upper lash line. Begin from the inner corner and work your way outward.</li>
      <li><strong>Create the Wing:</strong> Extend the eyeliner slightly past the outer corner of your eye, making sure the wing is positioned above the fold. Use a small angled brush for precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Fill in the Wing:</strong> Carefully fill in the wing to ensure it is fully defined. Make sure the line is even and smooth.</li>
      <li><strong>Line the Lower Lash Line:</strong> Use a pencil or gel liner to line the lower lash line, connecting it to the upper eyeliner. This creates a cohesive look and defines the eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean Up and Perfect:</strong> Use a cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to clean up any mistakes and sharpen the edges of your eyeliner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Eyeliner Formulas and Tools for Hooded Eyes</h2>
    <p>The choice of eyeliner formula and tools can significantly impact your application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pencil Eyeliner:</strong> Pencil eyeliners are easy to control and ideal for creating thin lines. Choose a waterproof formula to prevent smudging.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid Eyeliner:</strong> Liquid liners are great for precise, defined lines. Opt for a brush tip for better control and ensure it’s quick-drying to avoid transfer.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Gel eyeliners offer a creamy texture that can be applied with a brush. They are buildable and long-lasting, making them a good choice for hooded eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyeliner Brushes:</strong> Use a small, angled brush for applying gel liner or creating winged looks. A fine-tipped brush is excellent for precision work.</li>

    <h2>5. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <p>Avoid these common mistakes to ensure your eyeliner application is flawless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Using Too Much Product:</strong> Applying too much eyeliner can make your eyes look smaller and less defined. Stick to a thin line and build up if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Neglecting the Inner Corner:</strong> Don’t forget to line the inner corner of your eyes to open them up and create a balanced look.</li>
      <li><strong>Skipping Primer:</strong> Eye primer is essential for preventing smudging and ensuring your eyeliner stays in place throughout the day.</li>
      <li><strong>Applying Liner Too Close to the Lash Line:</strong> If you apply eyeliner too close to the lash line, it may get lost in the fold. Ensure there is a slight gap to make the liner visible.</li>
    </ul>
