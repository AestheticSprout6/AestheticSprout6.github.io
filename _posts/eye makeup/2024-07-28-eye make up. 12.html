    <h2>Identifying Your Eye Shape</h2>
    <p>Before diving into specific techniques, it's essential to accurately identify your eye shape. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the most common eye shapes and their characteristics:</p>
    <h3>Almond Eyes</h3>
    <p>Almond eyes are oval-shaped with slightly upturned outer corners, resembling the shape of an almond. This eye shape is highly versatile, allowing for a wide range of makeup styles. The balanced proportions make it easy to experiment with different looks, from natural to dramatic.</p>
    <h3>Round Eyes</h3>
    <p>Round eyes appear more open and larger. The width and height are nearly equal, giving a doe-eyed look. To elongate round eyes, focusing on creating a winged eyeliner effect and applying darker eyeshadows on the outer corners can be very effective.</p>
    <h3>Hooded Eyes</h3>
    <p>Hooded eyes have a fold of skin that droops over the crease, making the lid appear smaller. Makeup techniques that add depth and dimension, such as using lighter shades on the lid and darker shades in the crease, are ideal for hooded eyes. Avoid heavy eyeliner on the upper lid, as it can make the eyes appear smaller.</p>
    <h3>Monolid Eyes</h3>
    <p>Monolid eyes lack a defined crease, resulting in a flat eyelid space. This eye shape is common among people of Asian descent. Gradient eyeshadow techniques and tightlining the eyes can add depth and create the illusion of a crease, enhancing the natural beauty of monolid eyes.</p>
    <h3>Downturned Eyes</h3>
    <p>Downturned eyes have outer corners that slightly droop downward, giving a gentle, sleepy look. To lift the eyes, apply eyeliner that wings upward and focus on light, shimmery eyeshadows on the inner corners to brighten the eyes.</p>

    <h2>Makeup Techniques for Different Eye Shapes</h2>
    <h3>Almond Eyes</h3>
    <p>With almond eyes, the goal is to enhance the natural shape and create balance. Here are some makeup tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eyeshadow:</strong> Apply a medium shade over the lid, a darker shade in the crease, and a lighter shade on the brow bone. This classic technique works beautifully on almond eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyeliner:</strong> Winged eyeliner looks particularly stunning on almond eyes. Start thin at the inner corner and gradually thicken the line as you extend it outward.</li>
      <li><strong>Mascara:</strong> Focus on the outer lashes to emphasize the natural shape of the eyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Round Eyes</h3>
    <p>For round eyes, the objective is to create an elongated effect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eyeshadow:</strong> Use darker shades on the outer third of the eyelid and blend towards the center. Avoid heavy shadow on the inner corners.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyeliner:</strong> Apply a thin line along the upper lash line and extend it beyond the outer corner to create a wing. This helps elongate the eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Mascara:</strong> Focus on the center and outer lashes to open up the eyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hooded Eyes</h3>
    <p>Hooded eyes benefit from makeup techniques that create the illusion of a larger lid space:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eyeshadow:</strong> Apply a light shade on the lid and a darker shade above the natural crease to create depth. Avoid dark shades on the lid.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyeliner:</strong> Keep the liner thin and close to the lash line. Avoid thick lines that can make the lid space appear smaller.</li>
      <li><strong>Mascara:</strong> Use a volumizing mascara to lift the lashes and open up the eyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Monolid Eyes</h3>
    <p>For monolid eyes, the aim is to add dimension and create the illusion of a crease:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eyeshadow:</strong> Use a gradient technique with darker shades at the lash line and gradually lighter shades as you move upwards. This adds depth and dimension.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyeliner:</strong> Tightlining (applying liner on the upper waterline) helps define the eyes without taking up lid space.</li>
      <li><strong>Mascara:</strong> Curl the lashes and use lengthening mascara to open up the eyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Downturned Eyes</h3>
    <p>For downturned eyes, the goal is to lift and brighten the eyes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eyeshadow:</strong> Use lighter, shimmery shades on the inner corners and slightly darker shades on the outer corners, blended upwards.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyeliner:</strong> Apply eyeliner with an upward flick at the outer corners to lift the eyes. Avoid lining the lower lash line heavily.</li>
      <li><strong>Mascara:</strong> Focus on the upper lashes and apply an extra coat to the outer lashes to enhance the lift.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Eye Makeup Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <p>While experimenting with different eye makeup techniques, it's easy to make mistakes that can detract from your look. Here are some common mistakes to avoid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ignoring Eye Shape:</strong> Not tailoring your makeup to your eye shape can result in a look that doesn't enhance your natural features.</li>
      <li><strong>Overdoing Eyeliner:</strong> Thick, heavy eyeliner can make eyes look smaller, especially for hooded or small eyes. Stick to thinner lines for a more flattering look.</li>
      <li><strong>Skipping Primer:</strong> Eye primer ensures your eyeshadow stays in place and prevents creasing. Skipping this step can lead to smudged or faded makeup.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Blending:</strong> Harsh lines and unblended eyeshadow can look unpolished. Always take the time to blend your shadows seamlessly.</li>
      <li><strong>Using the Wrong Tools:</strong> Quality brushes make a significant difference in makeup application. Invest in good brushes for better results.</li>
    </ul>
