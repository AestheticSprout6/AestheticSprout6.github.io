    <h2>1. Understanding Different Types of Eyeliners</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right type of eyeliner is crucial for achieving the desired look. Here are the main types of eyeliners and their benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pencil Eyeliner:</strong> Easy to use and great for beginners, pencil eyeliners provide a softer, more natural look. They can be smudged for a smoky effect.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid Eyeliner:</strong> Ideal for creating precise, bold lines. Liquid eyeliners come with a fine brush or felt-tip applicator, perfect for sharp wings and graphic lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Offers the precision of liquid liner with the ease of application of a pencil. Gel liners are applied with a brush and are great for both bold and subtle looks.</li>
      <li><strong>Pen Eyeliner:</strong> Similar to liquid eyeliners but with a pen-like applicator, making them easy to control and ideal for creating fine lines and detailed designs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Preparing Your Eyes</h2>
    <p>Proper preparation ensures that your eyeliner goes on smoothly and lasts all day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clean Your Eyelids:</strong> Remove any excess oil, dirt, or makeup from your eyelids using a gentle cleanser or makeup remover.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply Primer:</strong> An eye primer helps create a smooth base, enhances the intensity of the eyeliner, and prevents smudging and fading.</li>
      <li><strong>Set with Powder:</strong> Lightly dust your eyelids with translucent powder to absorb excess oil and set the primer.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Basic Techniques for Applying Eyeliner</h2>
    <p>Here are some basic techniques for applying eyeliner, suitable for various looks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tightlining:</strong> Apply eyeliner along the waterline of your upper lashes to create the illusion of thicker, fuller lashes. This technique is subtle and natural-looking.</li>
      <li><strong>Classic Line:</strong> Draw a thin line along your upper lash line, starting from the inner corner and working towards the outer corner. Keep the line as close to the lashes as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Winged Liner:</strong> Extend the line slightly past the outer corner of your eye and angle it upwards to create a wing. Connect the tip of the wing back to the lash line and fill in the gap.</li>
      <li><strong>Smudged Liner:</strong> Apply a pencil or gel eyeliner along the upper lash line and use a smudging tool or brush to blend it out for a smoky effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>4. Advanced Techniques for Applying Eyeliner</h2>
    <p>Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can experiment with more advanced techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Double Wing:</strong> Create a classic winged liner on your upper lash line and add a second wing on the lower lash line, mirroring the upper wing.</li>
      <li><strong>Graphic Liner:</strong> Use liquid or gel eyeliner to create bold, geometric shapes and lines on your eyelids for a high-fashion look.</li>
      <li><strong>Cut Crease:</strong> Apply a line of eyeliner along the crease of your eyelid and blend it out to create a dramatic, defined crease.</li>
      <li><strong>Colorful Liner:</strong> Experiment with eyeliners in different colors to add a pop of color to your look. Bright blues, greens, and purples can be particularly striking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Tips for Perfecting Your Eyeliner</h2>
    <p>Follow these tips to achieve a flawless eyeliner application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Steady Your Hand:</strong> Rest your elbow on a flat surface to steady your hand and minimize shaking. You can also use your pinky finger to anchor your hand on your cheek.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Short Strokes:</strong> Instead of trying to draw one continuous line, use short, connected strokes for more control and precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Start Thin:</strong> Begin with a thin line and gradually build up the thickness to avoid applying too much product at once.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Symmetry:</strong> Ensure both eyes are symmetrical by checking your work in a mirror. You can use tape or a business card as a guide for creating even wings.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean Up Mistakes:</strong> Use a cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to clean up any mistakes or sharpen the edges of your eyeliner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Eyeliner for Different Eye Shapes</h2>
    <p>Tailor your eyeliner application to suit your eye shape for the most flattering results:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Almond Eyes:</strong> Almost any eyeliner style works well with almond eyes. Enhance the natural shape by following the curve of your lash line.</li>
      <li><strong>Round Eyes:</strong> Create a winged liner to elongate the eyes and give them a more almond-like appearance.</li>
      <li><strong>Hooded Eyes:</strong> Keep the liner thin and close to the lash line. For a winged look, extend the wing slightly upwards to avoid it getting lost in the crease.</li>
      <li><strong>Monolid Eyes:</strong> Use a thicker line to create more definition. Winged liner can also add dimension and open up the eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Downturned Eyes:</strong> Focus on the outer corners to lift the eyes. Create a subtle wing that angles upwards to counteract the downward slope.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Touch-Ups:</strong> Carry a small eyeliner pencil or pen for quick touch-ups throughout the day, especially if you have oily eyelids or watery eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Waterproof Options:</strong> Consider using waterproof eyeliner if you need long-lasting wear or if you’ll be exposed to water or sweat.</li>
      <li><strong>Gentle Removal:</strong> Use a gentle eye makeup remover or micellar water to remove eyeliner without tugging or irritating the delicate skin around your eyes.</li>
