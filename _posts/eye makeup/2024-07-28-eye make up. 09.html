    <h2>1. Understanding Your Eye Shape</h2>
    <p>Before selecting an eyeliner style, it’s essential to identify your eye shape. Here are the common eye shapes and how to recognize them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Almond Eyes:</strong> Characterized by their slightly pointed outer corners and a balanced shape that resembles an almond. The entire iris is visible when looking straight ahead.</li>
      <li><strong>Round Eyes:</strong> These eyes have a noticeable curve and appear larger and more prominent. The white of the eye is visible above and below the iris.</li>
      <li><strong>Hooded Eyes:</strong> Hooded eyes have a fold of skin that partially or completely covers the eyelid when the eye is open, often making the lid appear smaller.</li>
      <li><strong>Monolid Eyes:</strong> Monolid eyes lack a visible crease, creating a smooth surface from the lash line to the brow bone. The eyes can appear flat or slightly angled.</li>
      <li><strong>Downturned Eyes:</strong> Downturned eyes have a natural downward slant at the outer corners, giving them a softer, more rounded appearance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>2. Eyeliner Techniques for Different Eye Shapes</h2>
    <p>Once you’ve identified your eye shape, you can choose the best eyeliner techniques to enhance your features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Almond Eyes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Classic Line:</strong> Apply a thin line of eyeliner along the upper lash line. Extend the line slightly at the outer corner to accentuate the almond shape.</li>
          <li><strong>Winged Liner:</strong> Create a wing that extends upward and outward from the outer corner of your eye. This technique enhances the natural shape of almond eyes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Round Eyes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cat Eye:</strong> Apply eyeliner along the upper lash line and extend it beyond the outer corner with a sharp, upward flick. This elongates the eyes and creates a dramatic effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Lower Lash Line:</strong> Line the lower lash line with a matching pencil or gel liner. Connect it to the upper eyeliner for a cohesive look.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Hooded Eyes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thin Liner:</strong> Use a thin eyeliner along the upper lash line to avoid making the lid appear smaller. Avoid thick lines that can get lost in the fold.</li>
          <li><strong>Winged Liner:</strong> Extend the liner beyond the outer corner, making sure the wing is slightly above the hooded area to create the illusion of lifted eyes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Monolid Eyes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thick Liner:</strong> Apply a thicker line of eyeliner along the upper lash line to create definition. You can also extend the liner slightly beyond the outer corner.</li>
          <li><strong>Double Liner:</strong> Create a double line by applying a thin line of a different color or texture (like a glitter liner) above the main liner for added dimension.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Downturned Eyes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lifted Wing:</strong> Apply eyeliner along the upper lash line and create a wing that angles upwards. This technique helps lift the appearance of downturned eyes.</li>
          <li><strong>Inner Corner Highlight:</strong> Apply a light, shimmery liner or eyeshadow to the inner corners of the eyes to brighten and open up the eye area.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Choosing the Right Eyeliner Formula</h2>
    <p>The formula of your eyeliner can affect the ease of application and the final look. Here’s a guide to different eyeliner formulas and their best uses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pencil Eyeliner:</strong> Great for beginners and for creating softer lines. It’s versatile and can be used for tightlining, as well as for creating smoky looks. Choose waterproof pencils for long-lasting wear.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid Eyeliner:</strong> Ideal for precise, dramatic lines and winged looks. It dries quickly and provides intense color. Best for creating sharp, defined lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Gel Eyeliner:</strong> Offers the precision of liquid liner with the ease of a pencil. It’s buildable and works well for both bold and subtle looks. Ideal for creating smudge-proof lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Pen Eyeliner:</strong> Combines the convenience of a pen with the intensity of liquid eyeliner. It’s easy to use and great for quick, precise applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Tips for Flawless Eyeliner Application</h2>
    <p>Follow these tips to ensure your eyeliner looks perfect every time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Steady Your Hand:</strong> Rest your elbow on a flat surface and use your pinky to stabilize your hand while applying eyeliner.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Short Strokes:</strong> Instead of drawing a single line, use short, connected strokes for better control and a smoother finish.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Symmetry:</strong> Ensure that both eyes are lined evenly. Use a mirror to check for balance and make adjustments as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Set with Powder:</strong> After applying eyeliner, set it with a matching eyeshadow to prevent smudging and extend its wear.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean Up Mistakes:</strong> Use a cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to clean up any mistakes and refine the edges of your eyeliner.</li>
    </ul>
