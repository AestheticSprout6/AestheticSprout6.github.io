    <h2>1. Skipping Eye Primer</h2>
    <p>One of the most common mistakes is skipping the eye primer. Eye primer creates a smooth base for your eyeshadow, helping it adhere better and last longer. Without it, eyeshadow can crease, fade, and look uneven.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always apply a thin layer of eye primer before applying any eyeshadow. If you don't have a primer, a small amount of concealer or foundation can work as a substitute.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Using the Wrong Brushes</h2>
    <p>The tools you use can significantly impact the outcome of your makeup. Using the wrong brushes can lead to uneven application and difficulty in blending.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Invest in a good set of eye makeup brushes, including a blending brush, a flat shader brush, and a crease brush. Each brush has a specific purpose and helps achieve a polished look.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Over-Applying Eyeshadow</h2>
    <p>Applying too much eyeshadow at once can result in a heavy, cakey appearance. It’s easier to build up color gradually than to remove excess product.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Start with a small amount of eyeshadow and build up the color gradually. Tap off excess product from your brush before application to avoid fallout and ensure a smoother blend.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>4. Harsh Lines</h2>
    <p>Harsh lines from eyeshadow or eyeliner can make your makeup look unblended and unnatural. Blending is crucial for a seamless transition between colors.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Blend your eyeshadow well using a clean blending brush. For eyeliner, consider smudging the line slightly with a smudge brush or Q-tip for a softer look.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>5. Incorrect Eyeliner Application</h2>
    <p>Applying eyeliner can be challenging, and mistakes such as uneven lines or overuse can detract from your look.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Practice makes perfect. Start with a thin line and build up gradually if needed. For a winged look, use tape or a stencil to guide your application. Ensure both eyes are symmetrical by checking your work in a mirror.</p>

    <h2>6. Ignoring Your Eye Shape</h2>
    <p>Different eye shapes require different makeup techniques. Applying makeup without considering your eye shape can result in a look that doesn't enhance your features.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Identify your eye shape (hooded, monolid, almond, etc.) and research techniques that best enhance it. Tailor your application to highlight your unique features.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>7. Using Old Mascara</h2>
    <p>Mascara has a short shelf life, and using old mascara can lead to clumping and eye infections. It’s essential to replace your mascara regularly.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace your mascara every three months. If it starts to smell strange or becomes dry and clumpy before then, it’s time for a new tube.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>8. Neglecting the Lower Lash Line</h2>
    <p>Ignoring the lower lash line can make your eye makeup look incomplete. A bit of definition on the lower lash line can balance your overall look.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Apply a light eyeshadow or a smudge of eyeliner to the lower lash line. Use a smudge brush to blend it out for a soft, diffused look. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much product can make your eyes appear smaller.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>9. Forgetting to Highlight</h2>
    <p>Highlighting the inner corners of your eyes and the brow bone can make your eyes appear bigger and more awake. Skipping this step can result in a duller look.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a light, shimmery eyeshadow or highlighter to accentuate the inner corners of your eyes and the brow bone. This adds brightness and opens up the eyes.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>10. Over-Application of Concealer</h2>
    <p>Applying too much concealer around the eyes can lead to a cakey appearance and accentuate fine lines. It’s important to use the right amount and blend well.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a small amount of concealer and blend it out with a makeup sponge or brush. Setting it with a light dusting of translucent powder can help it stay in place without creasing.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>11. Not Setting Your Eyeshadow</h2>
    <p>Skipping the setting step can cause your eyeshadow to crease and fade throughout the day. Setting your eyeshadow helps it last longer and stay vibrant.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> After applying your eyeshadow, set it with a light dusting of translucent powder or a setting spray. This helps lock in the color and prevent creasing.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>12. Using the Wrong Color Palette</h2>
    <p>Choosing colors that don’t complement your skin tone or eye color can make your makeup look unflattering. It’s important to select shades that enhance your natural features.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Determine your undertone (cool, warm, neutral) and choose eyeshadows that complement it. Additionally, select colors that enhance your eye color; for example, warm browns and golds for blue eyes, or purples and plums for green eyes.</p>
